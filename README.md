I am a PhD student from the [Department of Government at the University of Essex (UK)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government). My research focuses on state's reaction to nonviolent conflicts, protest violence, foreign aid and post-conflict reconstruction. I am also interested in quantitative research methods, spatial econometrics, and data visulization.   

I am currently working on my PhD thesis under the tutelage of [Professor Kristian Gledistch](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=1BbBGWAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Sara Polo](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=Awc_N94AAAAJ).

I received a Master's degree in Security Studies at UCL, a Master's degree in Ethnicity and Multiculturalism from Univeristy of Bristol. I worked as a strategy associate at the Diplomatic Protocol Service Center, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing between 2016 and 2018. 

Favourite quotes:

> Discovering the unexpected is more important than confirming the known. \
> Data are not just numbers, they are numbers with a context.
